DescriptionCreate a starter catalog file with Docker and Docker Hub server entries as examplesUsage`docker mcp catalog bootstrap <output-file-path>`

## [Description](#description)

Create a starter catalog file with Docker Hub and Docker CLI server entries as examples. This command extracts the official Docker server definitions and creates a properly formatted catalog file that users can modify and use as a foundation for their custom catalogs.

The output file is standalone and not automatically imported - users can modify it and then import it or use it as a source for the 'catalog add' command.
