# docker compose restart

DescriptionRestart service containersUsage`docker compose restart [OPTIONS] [SERVICE...]`

## [Description](#description)

Restarts all stopped and running services, or the specified services only.

If you make changes to your `compose.yml` configuration, these changes are not reflected after running this command. For example, changes to environment variables (which are added after a container is built, but before the container's command is executed) are not updated after restarting.

If you are looking to configure a service's restart policy, refer to [restart](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/blob/main/spec.md#restart) or [restart\_policy](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/blob/main/deploy.md#restart_policy).

## [Options](#options)
