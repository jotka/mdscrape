# docker compose exec

DescriptionExecute a command in a running containerUsage`docker compose exec [OPTIONS] SERVICE COMMAND [ARGS...]`

## [Description](#description)

This is the equivalent of `docker exec` targeting a Compose service.

With this subcommand, you can run arbitrary commands in your services. Commands allocate a TTY by default, so you can use a command such as `docker compose exec web sh` to get an interactive prompt.

By default, Compose will enter container in interactive mode and allocate a TTY, while the equivalent `docker exec` command requires passing `--interactive --tty` flags to get the same behavior. Compose also support those two flags to offer a smooth migration between commands, whenever they are no-op by default. Still, `interactive` can be used to force disabling interactive mode (`--interactive=false`), typically when `docker compose exec` command is used inside a script.

## [Options](#options)

OptionDefaultDescription`-d, --detach`Detached mode: Run command in the background`-e, --env`Set environment variables`--index`Index of the container if service has multiple replicas`-T, --no-tty``true`Disable pseudo-TTY allocation. By default 'docker compose exec' allocates a TTY.  
`--privileged`Give extended privileges to the process`-u, --user`Run the command as this user`-w, --workdir`Path to workdir directory for this command
