The legacy versions of the Compose file reference has moved to the [V1 branch of the Compose repository](https://github.com/docker/compose/tree/v1/docs). They are no longer being actively maintained.

The latest and recommended version of the Compose file format is defined by the [Compose Specification](https://docs.docker.com/reference/compose-file/). This format merges the 2.x and 3.x versions and is implemented by **Compose 1.27.0+**. For more information, see the [History and development of Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/intro/history/).
