# No HTML link for pages

> Prevent usage of `<a>` elements to navigate to internal Next.js pages.

## [Why This Error Occurred](#why-this-error-occurred)

An `<a>` element was used to navigate to a page route without using the `next/link` component, causing unnecessary full-page refreshes.

The `Link` component is required to enable client-side route transitions between pages and provide a single-page app experience.

## [Possible Ways to Fix It](#possible-ways-to-fix-it)

Make sure to import the `Link` component and wrap anchor elements that route to different page routes.

**Before:**

pages/index.js

```
function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <a href="/about">About Us</a>
    </div>
  )
}
```

**After:**

pages/index.js

```
import Link from 'next/link'
 
function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Link href="/about">About Us</Link>
    </div>
  )
}
 
export default Home
```

### [Options](#options)

#### [`pagesDir`](#pagesdir)

This rule can normally locate your `pages` directory automatically.

If you're working in a monorepo, we recommend configuring the [`rootDir`](/docs/pages/api-reference/config/eslint#specifying-a-root-directory-within-a-monorepo) setting in `eslint-plugin-next`, which `pagesDir` will use to locate your `pages` directory.

In some cases, you may also need to configure this rule directly by providing a `pages` directory. This can be a path or an array of paths.

eslint.config.json

```
{
  "rules": {
    "@next/next/no-html-link-for-pages": ["error", "packages/my-app/pages/"]
  }
}
```
