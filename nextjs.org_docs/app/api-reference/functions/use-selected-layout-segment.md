# useSelectedLayoutSegment

`useSelectedLayoutSegment` is a **Client Component** hook that lets you read the active route segment **one level below** the Layout it is called from.

It is useful for navigation UI, such as tabs inside a parent layout that change style depending on the active child segment.

app/example-client-component.tsx

TypeScript

JavaScriptTypeScript

```
'use client'
 
import { useSelectedLayoutSegment } from 'next/navigation'
 
export default function ExampleClientComponent() {
  const segment = useSelectedLayoutSegment()
 
  return <p>Active segment: {segment}</p>
}
```

> **Good to know**:
> 
> - Since `useSelectedLayoutSegment` is a [Client Component](/docs/app/getting-started/server-and-client-components) hook, and Layouts are [Server Components](/docs/app/getting-started/server-and-client-components) by default, `useSelectedLayoutSegment` is usually called via a Client Component that is imported into a Layout.
> - `useSelectedLayoutSegment` only returns the segment one level down. To return all active segments, see [`useSelectedLayoutSegments`](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-selected-layout-segments)

## [Parameters](#parameters)

```
const segment = useSelectedLayoutSegment(parallelRoutesKey?: string)
```

`useSelectedLayoutSegment` *optionally* accepts a [`parallelRoutesKey`](/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/parallel-routes#with-useselectedlayoutsegments), which allows you to read the active route segment within that slot.

## [Returns](#returns)

`useSelectedLayoutSegment` returns a string of the active segment or `null` if one doesn't exist.

For example, given the Layouts and URLs below, the returned segment would be:

LayoutVisited URLReturned Segment`app/layout.js``/``null``app/layout.js``/dashboard``'dashboard'``app/dashboard/layout.js``/dashboard``null``app/dashboard/layout.js``/dashboard/settings``'settings'``app/dashboard/layout.js``/dashboard/analytics``'analytics'``app/dashboard/layout.js``/dashboard/analytics/monthly``'analytics'`

### [Creating an active link component](#creating-an-active-link-component)

You can use `useSelectedLayoutSegment` to create an active link component that changes style depending on the active segment. For example, a featured posts list in the sidebar of a blog:

app/blog/blog-nav-link.tsx

TypeScript

JavaScriptTypeScript

```
'use client'
 
import Link from 'next/link'
import { useSelectedLayoutSegment } from 'next/navigation'
 
// This *client* component will be imported into a blog layout
export default function BlogNavLink({
  slug,
  children,
}: {
  slug: string
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  // Navigating to `/blog/hello-world` will return 'hello-world'
  // for the selected layout segment
  const segment = useSelectedLayoutSegment()
  const isActive = slug === segment
 
  return (
    <Link
      href={`/blog/${slug}`}
      // Change style depending on whether the link is active
      style={{ fontWeight: isActive ? 'bold' : 'normal' }}
    >
      {children}
    </Link>
  )
}
```

app/blog/layout.tsx

TypeScript

JavaScriptTypeScript

```
// Import the Client Component into a parent Layout (Server Component)
import { BlogNavLink } from './blog-nav-link'
import getFeaturedPosts from './get-featured-posts'
 
export default async function Layout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  const featuredPosts = await getFeaturedPosts()
  return (
    <div>
      {featuredPosts.map((post) => (
        <div key={post.id}>
          <BlogNavLink slug={post.slug}>{post.title}</BlogNavLink>
        </div>
      ))}
      <div>{children}</div>
    </div>
  )
}
```
