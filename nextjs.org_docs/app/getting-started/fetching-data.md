# Fetching Data

This page will walk you through how you can fetch data in [Server and Client Components](/docs/app/getting-started/server-and-client-components), and how to [stream](#streaming) components that depend on data.

## [Fetching data](#fetching-data)

### [Server Components](#server-components)

You can fetch data in Server Components using any asynchronous I/O, such as:

1. The [`fetch` API](#with-the-fetch-api)
2. An [ORM or database](#with-an-orm-or-database)
3. Reading from the filesystem using Node.js APIs like `fs`

#### [With the `fetch` API](#with-the-fetch-api)

To fetch data with the `fetch` API, turn your component into an asynchronous function, and await the `fetch` call. For example:

app/blog/page.tsx

TypeScript

JavaScriptTypeScript

```
export default async function Page() {
  const data = await fetch('https://api.vercel.app/blog')
  const posts = await data.json()
  return (
    <ul>
      {posts.map((post) => (
        <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

> **Good to know:**
> 
> - `fetch` responses are not cached by default. However, Next.js will [pre-render](/docs/app/guides/caching#static-rendering) the route and the output will be cached for improved performance. If you'd like to opt into [dynamic rendering](/docs/app/guides/caching#dynamic-rendering), use the `{ cache: 'no-store' }` option. See the [`fetch` API Reference](/docs/app/api-reference/functions/fetch).
> - During development, you can log `fetch` calls for better visibility and debugging. See the [`logging` API reference](/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/logging).

#### [With an ORM or database](#with-an-orm-or-database)

Since Server Components are rendered on the server, you can safely make database queries using an ORM or database client. Turn your component into an asynchronous function, and await the call:

app/blog/page.tsx

TypeScript

JavaScriptTypeScript

```
import { db, posts } from '@/lib/db'
 
export default async function Page() {
  const allPosts = await db.select().from(posts)
  return (
    <ul>
      {allPosts.map((post) => (
        <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

### [Client Components](#client-components)

There are two ways to fetch data in Client Components, using:

1. React's [`use` hook](https://react.dev/reference/react/use)
2. A community library like [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) or [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest)

#### [Streaming data with the `use` hook](#streaming-data-with-the-use-hook)

You can use React's [`use` hook](https://react.dev/reference/react/use) to [stream](#streaming) data from the server to client. Start by fetching data in your Server component, and pass the promise to your Client Component as prop:

app/blog/page.tsx

TypeScript

JavaScriptTypeScript

```
import Posts from '@/app/ui/posts'
import { Suspense } from 'react'
 
export default function Page() {
  // Don't await the data fetching function
  const posts = getPosts()
 
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <Posts posts={posts} />
    </Suspense>
  )
}
```

Then, in your Client Component, use the `use` hook to read the promise:

app/ui/posts.tsx

TypeScript

JavaScriptTypeScript

```
'use client'
import { use } from 'react'
 
export default function Posts({
  posts,
}: {
  posts: Promise<{ id: string; title: string }[]>
}) {
  const allPosts = use(posts)
 
  return (
    <ul>
      {allPosts.map((post) => (
        <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

In the example above, the `<Posts>` component is wrapped in a [`<Suspense>` boundary](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense). This means the fallback will be shown while the promise is being resolved. Learn more about [streaming](#streaming).

#### [Community libraries](#community-libraries)

You can use a community library like [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) or [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) to fetch data in Client Components. These libraries have their own semantics for caching, streaming, and other features. For example, with SWR:

app/blog/page.tsx

TypeScript

JavaScriptTypeScript

```
'use client'
import useSWR from 'swr'
 
const fetcher = (url) => fetch(url).then((r) => r.json())
 
export default function BlogPage() {
  const { data, error, isLoading } = useSWR(
    'https://api.vercel.app/blog',
    fetcher
  )
 
  if (isLoading) return <div>Loading...</div>
  if (error) return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>
 
  return (
    <ul>
      {data.map((post: { id: string; title: string }) => (
        <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

## [Deduplicate requests and cache data](#deduplicate-requests-and-cache-data)

One way to deduplicate `fetch` requests is with [request memoization](/docs/app/guides/caching#request-memoization). With this mechanism, `fetch` calls using `GET` or `HEAD` with the same URL and options in a single render pass are combined into one request. This happens automatically, and you can [opt out](/docs/app/guides/caching#opting-out) by passing an Abort signal to `fetch`.

Request memoization is scoped to the lifetime of a request.

You can also deduplicate `fetch` requests by using Next.js’ [Data Cache](/docs/app/guides/caching#data-cache), for example by setting `cache: 'force-cache'` in your `fetch` options.

Data Cache allows sharing data across the current render pass and incoming requests.

If you are *not* using `fetch`, and instead using an ORM or database directly, you can wrap your data access with the [React `cache`](https://react.dev/reference/react/cache) function.

app/lib/data.ts

TypeScript

JavaScriptTypeScript

```
import { cache } from 'react'
import { db, posts, eq } from '@/lib/db'
 
export const getPost = cache(async (id: string) => {
  const post = await db.query.posts.findFirst({
    where: eq(posts.id, parseInt(id)),
  })
})
```

## [Streaming](#streaming)

> **Warning:** The content below assumes the [`cacheComponents` config option](/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/cacheComponents) is enabled in your application. The flag was introduced in Next.js 15 canary.

When you fetch data in Server Components, the data is fetched and rendered on the server for each request. If you have any slow data requests, the whole route will be blocked from rendering until all the data is fetched.

To improve the initial load time and user experience, you can use streaming to break up the page's HTML into smaller chunks and progressively send those chunks from the server to the client.

![How Server Rendering with Streaming Works](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Fserver-rendering-with-streaming.png&w=3840&q=75)![How Server Rendering with Streaming Works](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Fdark%2Fserver-rendering-with-streaming.png&w=3840&q=75)

There are two ways you can leverage streaming in your application:

1. Wrapping a page with a [`loading.js` file](#with-loadingjs)
2. Wrapping a component with [`<Suspense>`](#with-suspense)

### [With `loading.js`](#with-loadingjs)

You can create a `loading.js` file in the same folder as your page to stream the **entire page** while the data is being fetched. For example, to stream `app/blog/page.js`, add the file inside the `app/blog` folder.

![Blog folder structure with loading.js file](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Floading-file.png&w=3840&q=75)![Blog folder structure with loading.js file](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Fdark%2Floading-file.png&w=3840&q=75)

app/blog/loading.tsx

TypeScript

JavaScriptTypeScript

```
export default function Loading() {
  // Define the Loading UI here
  return <div>Loading...</div>
}
```

On navigation, the user will immediately see the layout and a [loading state](#creating-meaningful-loading-states) while the page is being rendered. The new content will then be automatically swapped in once rendering is complete.

![Loading UI](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Floading-ui.png&w=3840&q=75)![Loading UI](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Fdark%2Floading-ui.png&w=3840&q=75)

Behind-the-scenes, `loading.js` will be nested inside `layout.js`, and will automatically wrap the `page.js` file and any children below in a `<Suspense>` boundary.

![loading.js overview](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Floading-overview.png&w=3840&q=75)![loading.js overview](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fh8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com%2Fdocs%2Fdark%2Floading-overview.png&w=3840&q=75)

This approach works well for route segments (layouts and pages), but for more granular streaming, you can use `<Suspense>`.

### [With `<Suspense>`](#with-suspense)

`<Suspense>` allows you to be more granular about what parts of the page to stream. For example, you can immediately show any page content that falls outside of the `<Suspense>` boundary, and stream in the list of blog posts inside the boundary.

app/blog/page.tsx

TypeScript

JavaScriptTypeScript

```
import { Suspense } from 'react'
import BlogList from '@/components/BlogList'
import BlogListSkeleton from '@/components/BlogListSkeleton'
 
export default function BlogPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* This content will be sent to the client immediately */}
      <header>
        <h1>Welcome to the Blog</h1>
        <p>Read the latest posts below.</p>
      </header>
      <main>
        {/* If there's any dynamic content inside this boundary, it will be streamed in */}
        <Suspense fallback={<BlogListSkeleton />}>
          <BlogList />
        </Suspense>
      </main>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### [Creating meaningful loading states](#creating-meaningful-loading-states)

An instant loading state is fallback UI that is shown immediately to the user after navigation. For the best user experience, we recommend designing loading states that are meaningful and help users understand the app is responding. For example, you can use skeletons and spinners, or a small but meaningful part of future screens such as a cover photo, title, etc.

In development, you can preview and inspect the loading state of your components using the [React Devtools](https://react.dev/learn/react-developer-tools).

## [Examples](#examples)

### [Sequential data fetching](#sequential-data-fetching)

Sequential data fetching happens when one request depends on data from another.

For example, `<Playlists>` can only fetch data after `<Artist>` completes because it needs the `artistID`:

app/artist/\[username]/page.tsx

TypeScript

JavaScriptTypeScript

```
export default async function Page({
  params,
}: {
  params: Promise<{ username: string }>
}) {
  const { username } = await params
  // Get artist information
  const artist = await getArtist(username)
 
  return (
    <>
      <h1>{artist.name}</h1>
      {/* Show fallback UI while the Playlists component is loading */}
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        {/* Pass the artist ID to the Playlists component */}
        <Playlists artistID={artist.id} />
      </Suspense>
    </>
  )
}
 
async function Playlists({ artistID }: { artistID: string }) {
  // Use the artist ID to fetch playlists
  const playlists = await getArtistPlaylists(artistID)
 
  return (
    <ul>
      {playlists.map((playlist) => (
        <li key={playlist.id}>{playlist.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

In this example, `<Suspense>` allows the playlists to stream in after the artist data loads. However, the page still waits for the artist data before displaying anything. To prevent this, you can wrap the entire page component in a `<Suspense>` boundary (for example, using a [`loading.js` file](#with-loadingjs)) to show a loading state immediately.

Ensure your data source can resolve the first request quickly, as it blocks everything else. If you can't optimize the request further, consider [caching](#deduplicate-requests-and-cache-data) the result if the data changes infrequently.

### [Parallel data fetching](#parallel-data-fetching)

Parallel data fetching happens when data requests in a route are eagerly initiated and start at the same time.

By default, [layouts and pages](/docs/app/getting-started/layouts-and-pages) are rendered in parallel. So each segment starts fetching data as soon as possible.

However, within *any* component, multiple `async`/`await` requests can still be sequential if placed after the other. For example, `getAlbums` will be blocked until `getArtist` is resolved:

app/artist/\[username]/page.tsx

TypeScript

JavaScriptTypeScript

```
import { getArtist, getAlbums } from '@/app/lib/data'
 
export default async function Page({ params }) {
  // These requests will be sequential
  const { username } = await params
  const artist = await getArtist(username)
  const albums = await getAlbums(username)
  return <div>{artist.name}</div>
}
```

Start multiple requests by calling `fetch`, then await them with [`Promise.all`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/all). Requests begin as soon as `fetch` is called.

app/artist/\[username]/page.tsx

TypeScript

JavaScriptTypeScript

```
import Albums from './albums'
 
async function getArtist(username: string) {
  const res = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/artist/${username}`)
  return res.json()
}
 
async function getAlbums(username: string) {
  const res = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/artist/${username}/albums`)
  return res.json()
}
 
export default async function Page({
  params,
}: {
  params: Promise<{ username: string }>
}) {
  const { username } = await params
 
  // Initiate requests
  const artistData = getArtist(username)
  const albumsData = getAlbums(username)
 
  const [artist, albums] = await Promise.all([artistData, albumsData])
 
  return (
    <>
      <h1>{artist.name}</h1>
      <Albums list={albums} />
    </>
  )
}
```

> **Good to know:** If one request fails when using `Promise.all`, the entire operation will fail. To handle this, you can use the [`Promise.allSettled`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/allSettled) method instead.

### [Preloading data](#preloading-data)

You can preload data by creating an utility function that you eagerly call above blocking requests. `<Item>` conditionally renders based on the `checkIsAvailable()` function.

You can call `preload()` before `checkIsAvailable()` to eagerly initiate `<Item/>` data dependencies. By the time `<Item/>` is rendered, its data has already been fetched.

app/item/\[id]/page.tsx

TypeScript

JavaScriptTypeScript

```
import { getItem, checkIsAvailable } from '@/lib/data'
 
export default async function Page({
  params,
}: {
  params: Promise<{ id: string }>
}) {
  const { id } = await params
  // starting loading item data
  preload(id)
  // perform another asynchronous task
  const isAvailable = await checkIsAvailable()
 
  return isAvailable ? <Item id={id} /> : null
}
 
const preload = (id: string) => {
  // void evaluates the given expression and returns undefined
  // https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/void
  void getItem(id)
}
 
export async function Item({ id }: { id: string }) {
  const result = await getItem(id)
  // ...
}
```

Additionally, you can use React's [`cache` function](https://react.dev/reference/react/cache) and the [`server-only` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/server-only) to create a reusable utility function. This approach allows you to cache the data fetching function and ensure that it's only executed on the server.

utils/get-item.ts

TypeScript

JavaScriptTypeScript

```
import { cache } from 'react'
import 'server-only'
import { getItem } from '@/lib/data'
 
export const preload = (id: string) => {
  void getItem(id)
}
 
export const getItem = cache(async (id: string) => {
  // ...
})
```
