# Getting Started

Welcome to the Next.js documentation!

This **Getting Started** section will help you create your first Next.js app and learn the core features you'll use in every project.

## [Pre-requisite knowledge](#pre-requisite-knowledge)

Our documentation assumes some familiarity with web development. Before getting started, it'll help if you're comfortable with:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React

If you're new to React or need a refresher, we recommend starting with our [React Foundations course](/learn/react-foundations), and the [Next.js Foundations course](/learn/dashboard-app) that has you building an application as you learn.
